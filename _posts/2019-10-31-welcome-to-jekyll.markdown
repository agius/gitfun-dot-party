I've written quite a few Github Apps for personal projects and for work, and testing / QA work for them is always a pain. Things like pagination, rate limits, and all the combinations of resources and permissions can be frustrating to reproduce. I'm hoping with gitfun.party to put together a playground or sandbox to allow folks to test out their Github Apps and API integrations with real resources. And maybe have some fun in the bargain!
